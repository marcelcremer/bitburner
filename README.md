## My bitburner scripts

This repository contains my scripts for the game bitburner. See [more on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/).

### How it works

Install the vscode extension from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hexnaught.vscode-bitburner-connector). Activate the API as described and change the auth token inside the vscode configuration. This will allow VSCode to automatically upload your files from the dist folder to the game.

- Install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

- Run the compilation process:

```
npm run serve
```

Edit the code and have fun!
